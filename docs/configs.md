every one has their own favourite configs and keybindings.
Abstract try its best to provide likable configs and mapping.
so in case you don't like to use mapping or configs by Abstract,
you can change it in [override_defalut.lua](https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract/blob/main/lua/customs/override_defalut.lua)
file.
